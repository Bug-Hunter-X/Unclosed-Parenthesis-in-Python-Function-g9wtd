This repository contains a simple Python program demonstrating an uncommon coding error: an unclosed parenthesis in a function definition. The error is subtle and can be easily missed during code review. The solution demonstrates how to correctly close the parenthesis, and the bug file illustrates the issue.  This kind of error typically results in a `SyntaxError` from the interpreter.
